### here are all the qns
- ``basics`` will talk about the fundamentals, why a question is designed in such a way,
and how I would explain the concept
- ``medium`` are what I consider good questions to test someone's understanding, and to put
on a mock test
- ``hard`` are what I think can be sprinkles on as extra credit, and perhaps good for selecting
tutors.
