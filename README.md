## This is the collection of NYU Tandon CS Basics
### primarily for the Tutoring Center

- [questionsVault](./questionsVault) contains the markdown of questions
  - they are divided into ``basics``, ``medium``, and ``hard``

- [legacy](./legacy) contains a wild jumbo of code, mainly algorithms (leetcode stuff) done by me
over the years. They are good kill-time, but I do not recommend using them to 
design questions.
- This is WIP. And I am primarily focusing on Python related material. For now.
